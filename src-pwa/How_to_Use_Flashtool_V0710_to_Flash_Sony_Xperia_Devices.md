In this article, we will show you how to use Flashtool V0.7.1.0 to flash firmware files on your Xperia device. This version of Flashtool was released in 2012 and is compatible with Windows XP, Vista, 7, and 8. You can download it from [XDA Forums\[^1^\]](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/flashtool-v0-7-1-0.1635034/) or [GitHub\[^2^\]](https://github.com/Androxyde/Flashtool/releases).
 
## Prerequisites
 
- A Sony Xperia device with an unlocked bootloader. You can check the status of your bootloader by dialing \*#\*#7378423#\*#\* on your phone and going to Service info > Configuration > Rooting Status. If it says Bootloader unlock allowed: Yes, then you can proceed. If not, then you need to unlock your bootloader first by following [this guide](https://developer.sony.com/develop/open-devices/get-started/unlock-bootloader/).
- A USB cable to connect your phone to your computer.
- A firmware file for your Xperia device in FTF format. You can download official firmware files from [XperiFirm](https://xperifirm.com/) or [Xperia Stock ROM](https://www.xperiastockrom.com/). You can also create your own FTF file from a ZIP file by following [this guide](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/guide-how-to-create-a-ftf-file-from-a-zip-file-for-flashtool.1635035/).
- A backup of your data, as flashing a firmware file will erase everything on your phone.
